\section{How do I change the colors of links?}

The color of links can be changed to your liking using:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{urlcolor=red}!}, or

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{citecolor=green}!}, or

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{allcolor=blue}!}.

\noindent If you want to completely hide the links, you can use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{allcolors=.}!}, or even better: 

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{hidelinks}!}.

\noindent If you want to have obvious links in the PDF but not the printed text, use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{colorlinks=false}!}.
